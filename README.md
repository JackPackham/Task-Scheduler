# Standalone Task-Scheduler
my task scheduler app

Please understand that this is far from complete and is mearly an my own introduction into the world of coding in a somewhat 
profficient manor.
Nothing here is complete, nothing here is smooth though I am trying...

This project is a simple task-scheduler that i will eventually turn into a mobile app
I have trouble organising my life and thus wanted to create and app FOR MYSELF in order to have something bespoke for my own device
This is far from finished however and its my own gentle decension into coding in python and messing around with other medias,
enjoy!
